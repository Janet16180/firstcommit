The records of a repository snapshot: plain data, saved with the game and sent to the page.

`firstcommit.repomap` fills them from git; the save keeps the last ones observed, and the page
renders them. They live in the data layer, apart from the code that reads git, so the save can
type and check them without depending on it.

    One path and its blob id and mode in each of the three areas.

    the working copy would get if it were added (as ``git hash-object`` computes it).
    ``conflicted`` paths have no single staging-area blob, so their ``index`` is None.

    ``head_mode``, ``index_mode`` and ``folder_mode`` are git's modes: `FILE_MODE` for a file,
    `EXECUTABLE_MODE` for an executable one, `LINK_MODE` for a symbolic link and `GITLINK_MODE`
    for a repository; None exactly where the id is None. Two areas agree when both the id and
    the mode agree, so ``chmod +x`` alone is a change, as ``git status`` shows it.

    ``repository`` marks a folder holding a repository of its own: one nested in the working
    folder (``git status`` lists it as an untracked folder; its ``folder`` is its HEAD commit, or
    None before its first commit) or one recorded as a submodule (its ids are commits). Git
    never looks at the files inside it.
